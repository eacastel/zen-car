I reached out to Zen Car Buying to see if they could help and they turned me onto the idea of purchasing a slightly used luxury SUV EV. My Zen Guide educated me on the EV market and why buying used is a smart move. I couldn't be happier with my eTron, it even has massaging seats!",

    "quote": "I had an amazing experience with Zen Car Buying - I never knew a car concierge service like this existed! As a senior, buying a car can feel overwhelming, but they made it completely stress-free. I was looking for a Kia Soul, and they sourced great options, coordinated with dealerships to get photos, videos, and walkthroughs, and negotiated an excellent deal. They even helped process all the paperwork and delivered the car right to me. Their white glove service was professional, patient, and incredibly helpful. I love my new Kia Soul and truly appreciate how Zen Car Buying made the process simple, smooth, and enjoyable. Highly recommend!",

I knew what car and options I wanted, so my Zen Guide researched the vehicles to make sure I got exactly that. I highly recommend Zen Car Buying!",

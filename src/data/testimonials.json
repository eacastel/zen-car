Zen car buying helped me find and procure my dream car. Brian at Zen was amazing and made the whole process easy and and clear on how the process worked. with all the scams on-line this was well worth the assurance with having the help experience in on-line buying.  There was some issues with trucking but Brian was on top of it and got it handled in a timely manner.  I can't say anything bad about my experience with Zen car buying.",

    "quote": "I had an amazing experience with Zen Car Buying - I never knew a car concierge service like this existed! As a senior, buying a car can feel overwhelming, but they made it completely stress-free. I was looking for a Kia Soul, and they sourced great options, coordinated with dealerships to get photos, videos, and walkthroughs, and negotiated an excellent deal. They even helped process all the paperwork and delivered the car right to me. Their white glove service was professional, patient, and incredibly helpful. I love my new Kia Soul and truly appreciate how Zen Car Buying made the process simple, smooth, and enjoyable. Highly recommend!",

Not only is he extremely knowledgeable, but he was also prompt to answer any questions I had and had great advice on things I hadn’t even considered. The time saved looking for vehicles, not to mention the brain damage saved having to negotiate with salespeople was invaluable to me. I was also amazed at the range of vehicles he had knowledge of, from new electric vehicles to vintage, he can do it all. I highly recommend Brian to find the perfect vehicle for you with terms that would be difficult to obtain on your own. He far exceeded my expectations.",

He found her a great deal, handled all the legwork, and made sure she’d be taken care of by the dealership once the lease was set up. Even the guy at the dealership said Brian was the best broker he’d ever worked with and asked me, “Where’d you find him?”",

Brian handled everything from researching the best EV SUV options and incentives to calling multiple dealerships and negotiating directly with sales managers. He kept me updated every step of the way and ultimately landed me an incredible lease deal on a fully loaded Solterra. Picking up the car was effortless—everything was ready, no upselling, and I was out in two hours. The process was stress-free, transparent, and truly felt like having someone on my side. I can’t recommend Zen Car Buying enough!",

Zen car buying helped me find and procure my dream car. Brian at Zen was amazing and made the whole process easy and and clear on how the process worked. with all the scams on-line this was well worth the assurance with having the help experience in on-line buying.  There was some issues with trucking but Brian was on top of it and got it handled in a timely manner.  I can't say anything bad about my experience with Zen car buying.",

As a senior, buying a car can feel overwhelming, but they made it completely stress-free. I was looking for a Kia Soul, and they sourced great options, coordinated with dealerships to get photos, videos, and walkthroughs, and negotiated an excellent deal. They even helped process all the paperwork and delivered the car right to me. Their white glove service was professional, patient, and incredibly helpful. I love my new Kia Soul and truly appreciate how Zen Car Buying made the process simple, smooth, and enjoyable. Highly recommend!",

        <p><strong>(c) Website Transactions.</strong> At times, the Company will need personal information regarding a customer or a prospect. For example, to process an order or provide a consultation, the Company may need to know a customer's name, mailing address, email address and credit card details.

        <p><strong>(d) Lost or Stolen Information.</strong> If a customer's credit card is lost or stolen, the customer should promptly notify the Company in order to enable the Company to cancel the lost or stolen information and to update its records with a changed credit card.</p>
        <p><strong>(e) Links to Other Websites.</strong> A Website of the Company may contain links to other websites. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Websites.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. How the Information is Used.</h2>
        <p><strong>(a) Limited Uses Identified.</strong> Without customer's prior consent, the Company will not use your personal identifiable information for any purpose other than that for which it is submitted. The Company uses personal identifiable information to reply to inquiries, handle complaints, provide notices regarding its Services, and in program recordkeeping. The Company also (in conjunction with its third party payment processor) processes billing and business requests related to the Company’s Services offered on its Website.</p>
        <p><strong>(b) Stored Information Uses.</strong> The Company stores and retains the information provided by customer on the Company’s Website.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Disclosure of the Information.</h2>
        <p><strong>(a) Mergers and Acquisitions.</strong> Circumstances may arise where for business reasons, the Company decides to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize its businesses in the United States or some other country. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal identifying information to prospective or actual purchasers, and/or receiving such information from sellers. It is the Company 's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
        <p><strong>(b) Disclosure to Governmental Authorities.</strong> The Company may release personal information to appropriate governmental authorities where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena or Public Records Request) or by a regulation, or is requested by a government agency conducting investigations or proceedings.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Use of Computer Tracking Technologies.</h2>
        <p><strong>(a) No Tracking of Personal Information.</strong> The Company 's Website is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information not entered by visitors. Through website access logs the Company does collect clickstream data and HTTP protocol elements, which generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our sites. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff for research and development, user analysis and business decision making, all of which provides better services to the public. The statistics garnered, which contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information, may also be provided to third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>(b) Use of Cookies.</strong> The Company, or its third-party payment processor, collects non-identifiable and personal information through the use of various technologies, including "cookies". A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that a Website can transfer to customer's hard drive through customer's browser. The cookie is then stored on customer's computer as an anonymous tag that identifies the customer's computer, but not the customer. Cookies may be sent by the Company or its third-party payment processor. Customer can set their browser to notify Customer before a cookie is received, giving an opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. Customer can also set their cookie preferences on the Website’s homepage. Customer may also set their browser to turn off cookies; however, the Website may not then work properly.</p>
        <p><strong>(c) Use of Web Beacon Technologies.</strong> The Company may also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor its Website to provide better customer service. If these technologies are in use, when a visitor accesses these pages of the Website, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by the Company or by its suppliers. Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If customer does not want cookie information to be associated with customer's visits to these pages, customer can set its browser to turn off cookies; however, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.</p>
        <p><strong>(d) Collection of Non-Identifiable Information.</strong> The Company may collect non-identifiable information from user visits to the Company’s Website in order to provide better customer service. Examples of such collecting include: traffic analysis, such as tracking of the domains from which users visit, or tracking numbers of visitors; measuring visitor activity on the Company’s Website; Website and system administration; user analysis; and business decision making. Such information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." The Company may use this data to analyze trends and statistics.</p>
        <p><strong>(e) Collection of Personal Information.</strong> The Company collects personal identifying information from customers during a transaction. The Company may extract some personally identifying information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information, such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level (not at an individual level) to help the Company understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Information Security.</h2>
        <p><strong>(a) Commitment to Online Security.</strong> Billing and payment data is encrypted whenever transmitted or received online by the Company’s third-party payment processor. Personal information is accessible only by staff designated to handle online requests or complaints.</p>
        <p><strong>(b) No Liability for Acts of Third Parties.</strong> The Company will exercise all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of customer personal information. However, transmissions protected by industry standard security technology and implemented by human beings cannot be made absolutely secure. Consequently, the Company shall not be liable for unauthorized disclosure of personal information due to no fault of the Company including, but not limited to, errors in transmission and unauthorized acts of the Company’s staff and/or third parties.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Privacy Policy Changes and Opt-Out Rights.</h2>

Right of cancellation may be exercised by contacting the Company via email or certified postal mail. After processing the cancellation, the Company will delete customer or prospective customer's personal information from its database.</p>

        <p><strong>(c) Your California Privacy Rights.</strong> Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of the Company who are California residents to request certain information regarding the Company’s disclosure of personal information for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to: <a href="mailto:privacy@zencarbuying.com" className="text-accent hover:underline">privacy@zencarbuying.com</a>. Within 30 days of receiving such a request, the Company will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. The Company reserves its right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph. California's privacy laws require a company to provide notice to California users of their rights to receive information on to which entities their information was shared for marketing purposes.</p>
